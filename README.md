# User Experience (UX)

## User stories

![User Stories](assets/readme-images/users.png)
## Wireframes
The wireframes for ‘You Matter’ were produced in[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com).
There are frames for a full width display ( 1920 x 1080 )and a small mobile 
device (360 x 640). The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to bugs and design 
changes during development that occurred during the creation process.

# Design Choices
 When designing the quiz of the world I wanted the quiz game to be simple and educational. The index page contains a brief introduction to the game, with three buttons directly underneath introduction paragraph. 
 
 A feature that I knew I was implementing early on was highlight option so that the user knew exactly where they where on the page and what buttons they were clicking. The quiz itself is a multiple-choice quiz as I knew the some of the question might be a bit difficult. Included in the game is a progress bar and a score counter so that the user can keep an eye on there score while playing the game.
 
 I hope that the users take away a bit of knowledge form playing the quiz of the world.

Welcome to the history quiz, this quiz will test your knowledge on world history through out many different centuries of our history. 

Being a big fan of history and im always keen on learning as much as I can this why I choose to do a history quiz. We can learn so much from history and it is our jobs to pass this knowledge. Winston Churchill famously said, “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it”. 

After doing hours of research on what to do for my second project I kept coming across, the same results on the top 10 JavaScript projects for beginners and a quiz was in 90% of these this why I choose to build a quiz. 

Welcome to your guide through History Quiz <a href="https://jon9851.github.io/History-Quiz/" target="_blank" rel="noopner">History Quiz</a>

# User Experience (UX)

## User stories

 ### First time Vistor Goals 
1. I want a quiz that provides rules and instructions on how to play the game.
2. I would like to know where abouts on the page im on.
3. I want to be able to play the game either on laptop or on my phone. 

 ### Returning Vistor Goals   
1. I would have liked to see the correct answer appear in a different colour so that i knew what the answer was to the question.
2. The quiz seemed slow on my phone, changing questions wasn`t instant and took a few seconds to switch.

 ### Frequent User Goals
1. I would have like the questions to appear randomised every time I play so I am not answering the same questions every time I play.
2. I would like to have feedback on the questions i got correct or incorrect, some kind of idenifcation of the correct or incorrect answers would be greatly appreciated.

### User Feedback
Having reviewed the user goals i have implemented changes to the quiz game. This will satisfy all types of user whether your a first time user or a returning one.




# Wireframes
The wireframes for ‘You Matter’ were produced in[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com).
There are frames for a full width display ( 1920 x 1080 )and a small mobile 
device (360 x 640). The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to bugs and design 
changes during development that occurred during the creation process.

# Design Choices
 When designing the quiz of the world I wanted the quiz game to be simple and educational. The index page contains a brief introduction to the game, with three buttons directly underneath introduction paragraph. 
 
 A feature that I knew I was implementing early on was highlight option so that the user knew exactly where they where on the page and what buttons they were clicking. The quiz itself is a multiple-choice quiz as I knew the some of the question might be a bit difficult. Included in the game is a progress bar and a score counter so that the user can keep an eye on there score while playing the game.
 
 I hope that the users take away a bit of knowledge form playing the quiz of the world.

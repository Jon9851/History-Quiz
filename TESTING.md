# BUGS
The orginal design for the history quiz has changed a lot due to bugs and learning curves i faced during the development of this project. 

  1. color change when user selects wrong answer  does not activate.
  2. Question choices appear to small on smaller devices they do not fill up the full page.
  3. Timer does not function correclty after 60seconds. questions should have skip once the timer has ran out.
  4. During testing users score didnt save feature removed.
